# ARK-4 e/CFW for the PSP and PS Vita.

New, updated, improved and modern `Custom Firmware` for the `PSP` and `PS Vita`'s `ePSP`.
Simple to use and full of unique features, `ARK CFW` aims at keeping the `PSP` experience fresh. Being a successor to `PRO` and `ME`,
`ARK` is now the most feature-complete `CFW` for the `PSP`, having all features from classic `CFW`
as well as unique and exclusive new features not found anywhere else.

#### Installation On PSP

##### Installation from Custom Firmware
- If 6.61 PRO or ME is already installed.
- For any earlier CFW, update to latest 6.61 firmware and use instructions below for Official Firmware.
- Install DC-ARK (see bellow).
- Install New cIPL (see bellow).
- PowerOff console and power it back on while holding L button.
- Use DC to do a fresh and full install of 6.61 ARK.

##### Installation from Official Firmware
- If no custom firmware is installed (PSP is original).
- Copy `ARK_01234` folder into `/PSP/SAVEDATA/` folder.
- Copy `ARK_Loader` folder into `/PSP/GAME/` folder.
- Launch `ARK Loader`. It will install ARK modules on PSP Flash and boot the CFW.
- At this point `ARK` will work as a `Live CFW`, meaning that `ARK Loader` will need to be run every time the console is turned off or rebooted.
- To convert `ARK` into a `Permanent CFW` you can use `cIPL`.


##### Permanent CFW via cIPL

- Works on all PSP models, including testkits and devkits.
- Installer will choose the correct version according to your model.
- Some models can install either the Classic cIPL or the New cIPL.
- Copy `ARK_cIPL` folder to `/PSP/GAME/` and run the program.
- Press the corresponding button in the installation page to install or remove the cIPL patch.


##### Full Flash and Classic Installations

- This only make sense when combined with a permanent intallation (cIPL). It doesn't make sense on PSP Go with a healthy Internal Memory.
- This allows you to install and use all of ARK's features on the console's internal flash memory, except for Custom Launcher and translations.
- Copy `ARK_Full_Installer` to `/PSP/GAME/` and run it from `ARK`. It will install some extra files into the console's flash.
- If the `Custom Launcher` is not available (i.e. you delete the ARK savedata or remove the memory card), `PRO Shell` will take its place.
- When no savedata folder is available the default ARK path used to store settings will be `ms0:/SEPLUGINS/`.
- Even if files are stored in the console's flash memory, the ones in the savedata folder will still take priority in loading.
- If at this point you get rid of ARK's savedata then you will have a Classic Installation (ARK will behave much like your Classic CFW such as PRO or ME).


##### Time Machine and Despertar del Cementerio

- `Time Machine` allows the ability to boot the `6.61` firmware and `ARK` entirely from the Memory Stick.
- `Despertar del Cementerio` allows the ability to revive a bricked PSP when used in combination with a `Pandora` or `Baryon Sweeper`.
- You can install `DC-ARK` either using a `PSP` or a `PC` (Windows, Mac and Linux).
- On `PSP` you need to be running a `CFW` to install `DC-ARK` (ARK itself or any other).
- Copy the `ARK_DC` folder to the `/PSP/GAME/` folder and run the installer from the `XMB`.
- Copy the 6.61 Official Firmware Update by Sony renamed to `661.PBP` at the root of the memory stick.
- Follow the instructions to install DC-ARK and create a magic memory stick.
- On `PC`, you need `Python 3` and run `MagicMemoryCreator` with `admin`/`root` privileges.
- You can use New cIPL to boot into DC-ARK by holding L-trigger when powering on.
- Or use a `Pandora` or `Baryon Sweeper` in combination with your newly created `Magic Memory Stick` to boot up `Despertar del Cementerio`.
- On compatible models, you can use `Advanced VSH Menu` to create a `Pandora Battery`.
- From here you can either boot ARK from memory stick, install 6.61 Firmware with ARK on the NAND or install 6.61 Official Firmware.


#### Installation On PS Vita

There are two types of installation on PS Vita. You can use either one or both.
<br>Stanalone works on top of the original unmodified pspemu.
<br>You an also run ARK within Adrenaline to achieve a Hybrid CFW.


##### Standalone (Official PSPEmu)

- Works on Firmware 3.60 up to 3.74, requires Henkaku/h-encore or any native hack.
- Download and install <a href="https://github.com/Kethen/NoPspEmuDrm/releases/tag/2025-07-02">NoPspEmuDrm_mod</a> (you can use AutoPlugin2).
- Copy `FasterARK.vpk` from `PSVita/` folder anywhere on your vita and install using `VitaShell`. 
- Launch `FasterARK` and wait for the install process to finish.
- Both `ARK` and `ARK-X` bubbles will appear in `Live Area`.
- Use the `ARK` bubble for `PSP` games and homebrew. It can play `PS1` but with limitations related to sound playback.
- Use the `ARK-X` bubble for `PS1` games without any sound limitations.
- Once `ARK` bubbles are installed, you can delete `FasterARK`.
- To `exit` from a game or homebrew back to the `custom launcher`, press `L+R+Down+Start` (on `ARK-X` use `L2+R2+Down+Start` or `L1+R1+Start+Down` for `VitaTV`).
- NOTE: Some features are not available in standalone installations, mainly the official Sony `XMB`.
- NOTE: If you want to have an `ARK` bubble that works on `Official Firmware` you must use `ChovySign` with a valid license. Instructions in Wiki.


##### Adrenaline (Patched PSPEmu)

- Works on Firmware 3.60 up to 3.74, requires Henkaku/h-encore and <a href="https://github.com/isage/Adrenaline">Adrenaline</a> (Isage's fork is recommended, but original will work too).
- Install `ARK_01234` folder into `pspemu/PSP/SAVEDATA/` folder if it isn't already there.
- Install `ARK_Loader` folder into `pspemu/PSP/GAME/` folder.
- To make ARK-4 automatically load with Adrenaline there are two options.
- (Option 1, new method) Rename `ARK_Loader` to `BOOT`. Go to Adrenaline's Recovery Menu and in the Configuration page enable the `Autorun program` option. This only works on newer Adrenaline versions as the feature isn't implemented in older versions.
- (Option 2, old method) Use <a href="https://github.com/ONElua/AdrenalineBubbleManager/releases">Adrenaline Bubbles Manager</a> to create an autoboot bubble for `ARK Loader`. This method is deprecated as it will install an older version of Adrenaline.
- Note: this does not permanently modify `Adrenaline` in any way.


#### Updating ARK

##### There are three ways to update ARK:

- Option 1: Use the `System Update` ( `ARK-4 Updater` ) feature in the XMB. Requires your PSP/Vita to be connected to the internet.
- Option 2: Copy the `UPDATE` folder to `/PSP/GAME/` and run it.
- Option 3: Copy `ARK_01234` folder and (on PSP) run `ARK Loader` again to install new flash0 files.

#### Changelog

- `ARK-1`: original port/rewrite of `PRO CFW` for the `PS Vita`. Codenamed `PROVITA`. Source code can be found here: https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-1-PROVita-

- `ARK-3`: device-specific runtime allows `ARK` to run in multiple scenarios (`ePSP` and `ePSX`). Source code can be found here: https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-3

#### Warnings
<p>

- ARK comes with no warranty whatsoever. It was designed to be noob-proof, however it is possible for the universe to create an even greater noob capable of using ARK to destroy the Earth (or his PSP). I cannot be held responsible for this.

- ARK may cause ejectile malfunction if your hard drive is not hard enough.

- If this software malfunctions, you can turn it off and on again.

- ARK does not delete itself.
