Inferno Version 2 for ARK.

- Based on the original Inferno ISO Driver for PRO.

- Added support for JSO, CSOv2 and DAX file formats as well as dynamic block size.

- Fixed bug in sceUmdCheckMedium that would lock up when no ISO was actually set. Makes fake.cso unnecessary.

- Cache is now fully configurable (both size and memory partition), allowing it to be finetuned for 1K and Vita.

- Reworked static patches to dynamic ones, making it compatible accross all devices.
